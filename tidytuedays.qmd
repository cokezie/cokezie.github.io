This is where I will be displaying projects done under '#TidyTuesdays'. TidyTuesday is a weekly collaborative data project in which the Macalester mathematics, statistics, and computer science (MSCS) department students and staff have established in which to encourage a community effort in exploring the different ways we can configure and arrange the same data set to give us different conclusions and information. This valuable experience includes working with new data sets every week collaboratively in which to find different ways to visualize data and explore different tools, packages, and functions within R and SQL. My 'TidyTuesday' graphical summaries are presneted below.
