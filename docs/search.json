    "text": "Within a team of three, we conducted dimensional reduction analysis on a Premier League football (soccer) team. Our goal for this project is to use a classification algorithm to predict whether a Premier League home team will win, lose, or tie their match. We aim for our final model to have a high CV accuracy rate, showing that the model performs similarly well on unseen data as it does using the training data. We made a point not to prioritize a simple, easy-to-interpret model, but instead prioritize a model with higher accuracy. Because of this, we will need to be cognizant of how overfit our model may become to our training data.\nThe final LASSO/Linear Regression classification model incorporated an optimal set of variables and was fine-tuned with LASSO lambda in order to achieve an optimal balance between bias and variance. We conducted a grid search over a range of neighbor values and assessed the model to avoid overfitting. Our final model uses a lambda penalty value of 0.06250552 minimizing variables and utilizing what truly matters in order for us to obtain a final accuracy rate of 82.89%"

    "text": "After performing dimension reduction, we have found very valuable information regarding the data set. Firstly I can see how much original data and variability is represented by each principal component by utilizing the table and graph elements below. In this example we would find that 7 principal components are ideal because it would retain approximately 80% cumulatively of the original data This is ideal as it doesn’t sacrifice a lot of the original data but still brings variance that we are looking for. The var column is representative of amount of variability in the original features that is represented by each principal component.\n\n\nWe find that the first 2 principal components are representative of 40% of the variability in the principal components. After analyzing the score plot we find that the valence, loudness, speechiness and energy were all positively correlated to each other. And also that acousticness and danceability were negatively correlated with each other. We also find that energy, danceability and acousticness are well represented as we find that they have the highest magnitude comparatively. Key, mode, and instrumentalness are the lowest represented by the two dimensions. We can also observe that tempo is a really large contributor to Dim1 and time_signiture a large contributor to Dim2. Within the loadings plot above we can see that the later principal components account more for key, mode and instrumentalness which we saw was not represented as well by just simply the first two principal components."

    "text": "A transformative pedagogy is a teaching method that encourages students and teachers alike to critically examine their previous and current beliefs, values, and knowledge. With this, it aims to help people develop a sense of critical consciousness, agency, and empathy to appreciate different perspectives that often go unsaid. The Transformative Pedagogies Summer Institute is one component of Macalester’s three-pronged initiative focused on transforming what is taught and how it is taught at Macalester. I am extremely elated to be a part of this initiative to create a more inclusive, diverse, and respectful environment within classrooms. This topic relates to me personally as an African immigrant from Nigeria; the way in which I was raised and the intersectional world view that I hold are unique to me in a way where I don’t always feel that my opinion is as valued within classroom settings. The people that I see within my classrooms, both professors and students alike, do not look like me and thereby cannot know or relate to my experiences and the building blocks on which I stand to form my worldview and opinions. These experiences are common among people who have marginalized identities, and they shouldn’t be. This inspires me to be a part of creating more enriching and diverse classrooms so that people don’t have to feel the same way that I have in the past. Within my participation in Macalester’s transformative pedagogies institute, I work with a team under the leadership of scholar Ms. Ebony Aya to cultivate learning on the end of both professors and students alike, learning rich in perspective, understanding, and empathy. Our team is composed of multiple professors within various departments and a diverse array of students. We have all come together with an awareness that growth and change need to happen, and in this, establishing a goal to create classrooms that are more centered on developing a sense of critical consciousness and empathy towards giving and receiving these opinions. Additionally, this program initiates learning how to navigate conversations about race, upbringing, and culture in a way that appreciates, validates, and creates learning opportunities out of every person’s individual experience, no matter how different it might be from our own. I will close with a quote that I like from a Macalester graduate, Gabby Whitehurst, who said, “In a society that runs off of complacency and a stunted imagination, building your capacity to just think is extremely powerful. Taking action without introspection doesn’t necessarily lead to growth and is often reactionary, rather than being rooted in omnipresent love for human rights,” and within this Transformative Pedagogies Institute, I have a personal goal to implement her words within my work and also within my life.\n\n\n\nAs someone who deeply values family and caring community, I found it extremely hard to leave my family, cousins, and friends to move from Detroit, MI, to St. Paul, MN, as I was going to miss the people in my life deeply, and I wasn’t sure if I would be able to make connections like that again. As a result, I made it a mission to commit to finding, if not creating, a caring community of my own. I was able to find this through volunteering with the Commonbond communities within the Skyline Tower of St. Paul. CommonBond is an affordable housing nonprofit that serves low-income communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and South Dakota. Within that commitment to serve these communities, they provide extra learning opportunities led by volunteers. Within my position as a Commonbond volunteer, I worked to build trust and a community bond between myself and up to 6 kids, utilizing SEL (Social-Emotional Learning) activities along with making sure that we were completing their assigned reading for their grade level. I made sure to exercise patience, understanding, and respect in my interactions, ensuring that I was setting a good example for the kids around me. I worked to adapt to different grade levels and learning styles, aiming to help each individual student’s needs’ in which to successfully complete their assignments and reading goals. I led and facilitated discussions with up to 6 kids to establish 2 practical reading goals per week.\n\n\n\nAs someone who is committed to community engagement and providing a sense of community to others, this summer I held a position as an orientation leader. With this, I helped to lead and organize group meetings covering what it means to be a part of Macalester College and facilitating group discussions to successfully cultivate a sense of belonging within the 15+ group of freshman students that I was given the responsibility of leading. I planned and facilitated 1:1 meetings in which to dive deeper into each person’s individual needs and questions. Also, I utilized the information from these meetings to construct group meetings that answered commonly asked questions and provided free resources at Macalester that would help them. I was also tasked with providing incoming freshman Macalester College students with information regarding mental, physical, and sexual health, Title IX, academic integrity policies, etc. I helped to give the students advice about college, show them where their classes are, and display the inner workings, colloquials, and inside jokes of Macalester College. I helped these students feel and see that Macalester College is a place in which they belong. Macalester is a place where they will not only find forever friends but a second home and chosen family. Additionally, a place where you will be intellectually, emotionally, and physically challenged in a way that excites you and builds up perseverance and a love for the people that are able to guide and protect you through the good and the crest and the troughs. I worked to lead group meetings covering what it means to be a part of Macalester College and the diverse perspective that they bring to the college, each of them very unique individuals with diverse backgrounds and interests. I also worked to organize a night in which everyone from our original orientation group reconvened to read letters that they wrote to themselves, catch up with some of the first people that they met at Macalester, enjoy good food, and for me to catch up with them and their lives, seeing if there is any additional assistance that I can provide in which to help them to have a fruitful Macalester education and experience. During this, we reflected on their first thoughts when they had arrived and explored what had changed since then. Furthermore, from this experience I have learned a lot about how to create and sustain a community as well as how to effectively lead a group while also prioritizing everyone’s individual needs."
