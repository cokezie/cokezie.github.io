    "text": "Overall, our general goal with this project was to to utilize a combination of L-systems and Python Turtle Wirting, in order to display the building process of a fractal tree that could potentially go on forever. We introduced a user interface aspect as we asked the user questions within the Python Console in which to customize their tree. The user could pick artifacts such as how long/big the tree was, how thick the stump is, color customization, how many branches, and even more than that! A run of the program would create a tree of their own design, and display it within a new window."

The insights gained from this comparison will help us determine whether our chosen quality metrics have improved over time. We then evaluated our novel quality metric assessment tool against the dataset generated from our empirical study, measuring Cohen’s kappa score, accuracy, recall, and other metrics with the goal of assessing the validity of our collected data and tool. When our tool was fine tuned and gave us the accuracy score that we had aimed for, we utilized the tool to analyze even larger code commits, eventually analyzing the changes in over 1,000 code commits.\nFrom the analysis, we gained insight into the specific details that enhance our studied metrics, enabling us to be able to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of our work and what we’ve learned. This taxonomy outlines each of the changes that contributed to the enhancement of each quality metric. The creation and work done on this taxonomy accomplished our original goal of creating a foundational work for automating quality enhancement changes in machine learning-powered software for enhancing accessibility for all.\nProduct:\nLink to published paper coming soon, November 2024."

Our goal for this project is to use a classification algorithm to predict whether a Premier League home team will win, lose, or tie their match. We aim for our final model to have a high CV accuracy rate, showing that the model performs similarly well on unseen data as it does using the training data. We made a point not to prioritize a simple, easy-to-interpret model, but instead prioritize a model with higher accuracy. Because of this, we will need to be cognizant of how overfit our model may become to our training data.\nThe final LASSO/Linear Regression classification model incorporated an optimal set of variables and was fine-tuned with LASSO lambda in order to achieve an optimal balance between bias and variance. We conducted a grid search over a range of neighbor values and assessed the model to avoid overfitting. Our final model uses a lambda penalty value of 0.06250552 minimizing variables and utilizing what truly matters in order for us to obtain a final accuracy rate of 82.89%."

    "text": "Transformative pedagogy is a teaching method that encourages students and teachers alike to critically examine their previous and current beliefs, values, and knowledge. It aims to help people develop a sense of critical consciousness, agency, and empathy to appreciate different perspectives. The Transformative Pedagogies Summer Institute is one component of Macalester’s three-pronged initiative that focuses on transforming what is taught and how it is taught at Macalester. I am extremely elated to be a part of this initiative and to help create a more inclusive, diverse, and respectful environment within the classrooms. I personally relate to this topic. As an African immigrant from Nigeria, the way in which I was raised and the intersectional world view that I hold are unique to me. Because of this, I don’t always feel that my opinion and/or suggestions are valued in classroom settings.\nFor the most part, the people that I interact with in my classes, both professors and students alike, do not look like me, nor think like me, and thereby cannot relate to my experiences and the building blocks on which I stand to form my worldview and opinions. These experiences are common among people who have marginalized identities, and they shouldn’t be. This is the driving force inspiring me to create more enriching and diverse classrooms so that people don’t have to feel the same way that I have in the past. \nIn Macalester’s transformative pedagogies institute, I work with a team under the leadership of Professor Ebony Aya, a scholar in her own right, to cultivate a learning environment for both professors and students alike, learning rich in perspective, understanding, and empathy. Our team is composed of many professors from various departments and a diverse array of students. We have all come together with an awareness that growth and change need to happen, and with that in mind, establishing a goal to create classrooms that are more centered on developing a sense of critical consciousness and empathy towards differing opinions. \nAdditionally, this program initiates learning how to navigate conversations about race, upbringing, and culture in a way that appreciates, validates, and creates learning opportunities for every person’s individual experience, no matter how different it might be from our own. I will close with a quote that I like from a Macalester graduate, Gabby Whitehurst, who said, “In a society that runs off of complacency and a stunted imagination, building your capacity to just think is extremely powerful. [Acting] without introspection doesn’t necessarily lead to growth and is often reactionary, rather than being rooted in omnipresent love for human rights,” and within this Transformative Pedagogies Institute, I have a personal goal to implement these words within my work and life.\n\n\n\nAs someone who deeply values family and a caring community, I found it extremely hard to leave my family, uncles, cousins, and friends to move from Detroit, MI, to St. Paul, MN. This was hard because I was going to miss the people that I have loved and known all my life. I wasn’t sure if I would be able to make connections like that again. As a result of this experience, I made it a mission to commit to finding, if not creating, a caring community of my own. I was able to find this through volunteering with the Commonbond communities within the Skyline Tower of St. Paul. CommonBond is an affordable housing nonprofit that serves low-income communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and South Dakota. My commitment to serving these communities in my little way is a welcome opportunity, which I would not gain any other way. \nIn my position as a Commonbond volunteer, I worked to build trust and a community bond between myself and the kids under my care, utilizing social-emotional learning (SEL) activities along with making sure that we were completing their assigned reading for their grade level. I made sure to exercise patience, understanding, and respect in my interactions, ensuring that I was setting a good example for the kids around me. I worked to adapt to different grade levels and learning styles with the aim of helping each individual student meet their individual needs. That is, to successfully complete their assignments and reading goals. I also led and facilitated discussions with the kids with the aim of achieving two practical reading goals per week.\n\n\n\nIn furtherance to my goal of community engagement, this past summer, I served as an orientation leader to 16 freshmen individuals with diverse backgrounds and interests. In this role, I led, planned, and facilitated one-on-one discussions, group discussions, and organized group meetings covering such topics as what it means to be a part of Macalester College, including providing them with information regarding mental, physical, and sexual health, Title IX, academic integrity policies, etc. I also advised them on how to be successful in college, showed them where their classes are, and told them quirkities and traditions of Macalester College. \nI also organized a night when everyone from our original orientation group reconvened to share letters that they wrote to themselves with the group, catch up with some of the first people that they met at Macalester, enjoy good food, and for me, to catch up with them and their challenges. During this meeting, based on their challenges, I will check if there is additional assistance that I can provide to help them have a fruitful Macalester education and experience. Also at this meeting, we reflected on their first thoughts when they first arrived on campus and explored what had changed since then.\nThe aim of all this was to help these students feel at home at Macalester College. The bottom line is that college is a major commitment. Macalester is a place where they will not only find forever friends but a second home and a welcoming community. A community that will be there during the thick and thin days of college life. Additionally, a place where they will be intellectually, emotionally, and physically challenged in a way that no other institution can.\nFor me, I have enjoyed this experience and have learned a lot about how to create and sustain a community as well as how to effectively lead a group while also prioritizing everyone’s individual needs.\n\n\n\nThe Mac Mentorship Program is a year-long mentoring program between Macalester students and high school juniors and seniors in the TRIO Upward Bound program at North Hennepin Community College (NHCC). The program begins in the spring semester and continues to the fall semester of the 2025 academic year. As a mentor, I will be working with the same group of mentees starting from their junior year to senior year. This program provides guidance and support to high school students, including integrating them into the college community. With this experience, I hope to learn about the difficulties that others face as they begin their college application and finally as they secure admission into college. Also, I hope to learn about securing the finance that is required for their education, including becoming acquainted with the common questions associated with college and what others find difficult about the experience. There is no question that with this experience, there is much to learn and skills to repurpose."

To do this, we utilized automatic accessibility testing automation tools such as WAVE Accessibility Checker to identify and fix accessibility issues of the evaluated applications. In our work, we explored 115 different websites across over 6 different fields, including education, transportation, healthcare, finance, news, social media, etc. From our analysis, we found over 50+ different accessibility issues of varying levels of issue severity.\nAfter compiling over 1000+ rows of data concerning the issue type, interface concerned, issue importance, issue occurrence number, WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) level and category, proposed improvement according to WGAC standards, and more data, we sought to explore different research questions utilizing our compiled data. Through our data, we examined patterns of accessibility issues across fields and compared the number of visual components (structural elements and features) with the number of accessibility issues to explore the correlation between these. In addition to this, we proposed research questions exploring the co-occurrence of accessibility issues across fields, evaluated the compliance of these webpages to the WCAG categories of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust, and measured their adherence to each of the WCAG 2.1 conformance levels (A, AA, AAA) per field. Among these subjects, we explored more than just this, all of which was composed within the papers that we had drafted within the research experience, which will be published soon.\nProduct:\nLink to published paper coming soon, December 2024."

From this investigation, we found very valuable information regarding the data set and had a lot of takeaways regarding data analysis and the best ways to present data/or the result to different audiences. Firstly, we had to make sure that the original data was securely preserved while also creating variability within the data. With that understanding, we thought dimension reduction was the best to be used to perform this analysis. We found percentages of original data and variability are represented by each principal component by utilizing tables and graph elements composed within Rstudio. In this example, we would find that establishing 7 principal components within our analysis is ideal because it would retain approximately 80% cumulatively of the original data while also allowing for variability.\nWithin this project, we were able to experiment with different machine learning models and analyses. With this, further knowledge was gained on how to store data and the best way to experiment with and represent data in a way that is easy to understand for the viewers, researchers, and statisticians alike."
