    "text": "This TidyTuesdays submission analyzes the “Summer Movies” data set; movies with “summer” in the title of it. More information about the data set can be found here.\nThe graph above compares the average viewer rating with the time period of movie release, also considering how this would change dependent on the run time of the movie. On the x axis maps the time period of the move release, and the y axis maps the average viewer rating with separate graphs for different run times. Additionally, there is an overall mean average viewer rating across all time periods and run times of 6.3/10, and we can see how the median of each box plot compares to this.\nIn analyzing the graph, we find that movies produced in the 2001 – 2025 time period have much more variety in average viewer rating than seen within the other time periods. This could be for a multitude of reasons, one being that the number of “summer” movies that were produced is much higher.\nAdditionally, we observe that from years 0 - 1950 longer movies had the highest median average viewer rating of this category, though we also see a very little amount of variability. In this, we could hypothesize that the few movies that were produced with a longer run time were more thought out and intentional, attributing to people having high appreciation for the film.\nSimilarly to the years 0 – 1950, we also saw a positive increase in median average viewer rating between ‘Summer’ movies released in 1950 – 1975, dependent on movie run time. In this, higher run times of ‘Summer’ movies had higher median values amongst these audiences. Though we don’t observe the same increase within the 1976 – 2000 and 2001 – 2025 time periods.\nThis brings up an interesting contrast in recent vs. older years where we observe within the data that as run time increases in older years, the median average viewer rating increases, not finding this same pattern in 1976 – 2000 and 2001 – 2025 time periods. In fact, within the 0 – 60 minute run time graph, we find that over time, the median average viewer rating becomes much higher. This hints at recent conversations that people have had with regard to decreasing attention span and the ways in which we see this show up within our society, this being an example of such. Further studies would have to be done to prove this association, though it is interesting to consider here.

We introduced a user interface aspect as we asked the user questions within the Python Console in which to customize their tree. The user could pick artifacts such as how long/big the tree was, how thick the stump is, color customization, how many branches, and even more than that! A run of the program would create a tree of their own design, and display it within a new window."

    "text": "A project that I worked on with professor Marouane Kessentini of the University of Michigan-Flint and Mr. Mohamed Almukhtar, a University of Michigan-Flint doctoral student, focused on the creation of foundational work for automating quality enhancement changes in machine learning-powered accessibility software.\nIn this project, we conducted an empirical study using open-source GitHub projects to access and focus on quality metrics of code commits and compare them with their parent commits. The insights gained from this comparison will help us determine whether our chosen quality metrics have improved over time. We then evaluated our novel quality metric assessment tool against the dataset generated from our empirical study, measuring Cohen’s kappa score, accuracy, recall, and other metrics with the goal of assessing the validity of our collected data and tool. When our tool was fine tuned and gave us the accuracy score that we had aimed for, we utilized the tool to analyze even larger code commits, eventually analyzing the changes in over 1,000 code commits.\nFrom the analysis, we gained insight into the specific details that enhance our studied metrics, enabling us to be able to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of our work and what we’ve learned. This taxonomy outlines each of the changes that contributed to the enhancement of each quality metric. The creation and work done on this taxonomy accomplished our original goal of creating a foundational work for automating quality enhancement changes in machine learning-powered software for enhancing accessibility for all.\nProduct:\nLink to published paper coming soon, November 2024."

Our goal for this project is to use a classification algorithm to predict whether a Premier League home team will win, lose, or tie their match. We aim for our final model to have a high CV accuracy rate, showing that the model performs similarly well on unseen data as it does using the training data. We made a point not to prioritize a simple, easy-to-interpret model, but instead prioritize a model with higher accuracy. Because of this, we will need to be cognizant of how overfit our model may become to our training data.\nThe final LASSO/Linear Regression classification model incorporated an optimal set of variables and was fine-tuned with LASSO lambda in order to achieve an optimal balance between bias and variance. We conducted a grid search over a range of neighbor values and assessed the model to avoid overfitting. Our final model uses a lambda penalty value of 0.06250552 minimizing variables and utilizing what truly matters in order for us to obtain a final accuracy rate of 82.89%."

    "text": "Transformative pedagogy is a teaching method that encourages students and teachers alike to critically examine their previous and current beliefs, values, and knowledge. It aims to help people develop a sense of critical consciousness, agency, and empathy to appreciate different perspectives. The Transformative Pedagogies Summer Institute is one component of Macalester’s three-pronged initiative that focuses on transforming what is taught and how it is taught at Macalester. I am extremely elated to be a part of this initiative and to help create a more inclusive, diverse, and respectful environment within the classrooms. I personally relate to this topic. As an African immigrant from Nigeria, the way in which I was raised and the intersectional world view that I hold are unique to me. Because of this, I don’t always feel that my opinion and/or suggestions are valued in classroom settings.\nFor the most part, the people that I interact with in my classes, both professors and students alike, do not look like me, nor think like me, and thereby cannot relate to my experiences and the building blocks on which I stand to form my worldview and opinions. These experiences are common among people who have marginalized identities, and they shouldn’t be. This is the driving force inspiring me to create more enriching and diverse classrooms so that people don’t have to feel the same way that I have in the past.\nIn Macalester’s transformative pedagogies institute, I work with a team under the leadership of Professor Ebony Aya, a scholar in her own right, to cultivate a learning environment for both professors and students alike, learning rich in perspective, understanding, and empathy. Our team is composed of many professors from various departments and a diverse array of students. We have all come together with an awareness that growth and change need to happen at and beyond Macalester. With this in mind we work to accomplish a goal to create classrooms that are more centered on developing a sense of critical consciousness and empathy towards differing opinions.\nAdditionally, this program initiates learning how to navigate conversations about race, upbringing, and culture in a way that appreciates, validates, and creates learning opportunities for every person’s individual experience, no matter how different it might be from our own. I will close with a quote that I like from a Macalester graduate, Gabby Whitehurst, who said, “In a society that runs off of complacency and a stunted imagination, building your capacity to just think is extremely powerful. [Acting] without introspection doesn’t necessarily lead to growth and is often reactionary, rather than being rooted in omnipresent love for human rights,” and within this Transformative Pedagogies Institute, I have a personal goal to implement these words within my work and life.\n\n\n\nAs someone who deeply values family and a caring community, I found it extremely hard to leave my family, uncles, cousins, and friends to move from Detroit, MI, to St. Paul, MN. This was hard because I was going to miss the people that I have loved and known all my life. I wasn’t sure if I would be able to make connections like that again. As a result of this experience, I made it a mission to commit to finding, if not creating, a caring community of my own. I was able to find this through volunteering with the Commonbond communities within the Skyline Tower of St. Paul. Commonbond is an affordable housing nonprofit that serves low-income communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and South Dakota. My commitment to serving these communities in my little way is a welcome opportunity, which I would not gain any other way.\nIn my position as a Commonbond volunteer, I worked to build trust and a community bond between myself and the kids under my care, utilizing social-emotional learning (SEL) activities along with making sure that we were completing their assigned reading for their grade level. I made sure to exercise patience, understanding, and respect in my interactions, ensuring that I was setting a good example for the kids around me. I worked to adapt to different grade levels and learning styles with the aim of helping each individual student meet their individual needs. That is, to successfully complete their assignments and reading goals. I also led and facilitated discussions with the kids with the aim of achieving two practical reading goals per week.\n\n\n\nIn furtherance to my goal of community engagement, this past summer, I served as an orientation leader to 16 freshmen individuals with diverse backgrounds and interests. In this role, I led, planned, and facilitated one-on-one discussions, group discussions, and organized group meetings covering such topics as what it means to be a part of Macalester College, including providing them with information regarding mental, physical, and sexual health, Title IX, academic integrity policies, etc. I also advised them on how to be successful in college, showed them where their classes are, and told them quirkities and traditions of Macalester College.\nI also organized a night when everyone from our original orientation group reconvened to share letters that they wrote to themselves with the group, catch up with some of the first people that they met at Macalester, enjoy good food, and for me, to catch up with them and their challenges. During this meeting, based on their challenges, I will check if there is additional assistance that I can provide to help them have a fruitful Macalester education and experience. Also at this meeting, we reflected on their first thoughts when they first arrived on campus and explored what had changed since then.\nThe aim of all this was to help these students feel at home at Macalester College. The bottom line is that college is a major commitment. Macalester is a place where they will not only find forever friends but a second home and a welcoming community. A community that will be there during the thick and thin days of college life. Additionally, a place where they will be intellectually, emotionally, and physically challenged in a way that no other institution can.\nFor me, I have enjoyed this experience and have learned a lot about how to create and sustain a community as well as how to effectively lead a group while also prioritizing everyone’s individual needs.\n\n\n\nThe Mac Mentorship Program is a year-long mentoring program between Macalester students and high school juniors and seniors in the TRIO Upward Bound program at North Hennepin Community College (NHCC). The program begins in the spring semester and continues to the fall semester of the 2025 academic year. As a mentor, I will be working with the same group of mentees starting from their junior year to senior year. This program provides guidance and support to high school students, including integrating them into the college community. With this experience, I hope to learn about the difficulties that others face as they begin their college application and finally as they secure admission into college. Also, I hope to learn about securing the finance that is required for their education, including becoming acquainted with the common questions associated with college and what others find difficult about the experience. There is no question that with this experience, there is much to learn and skills to repurpose.\n\n\n\nIn the 1930s, Rondo Avenue was at the heart of St. Paul, Minnesota’s largest Black neighborhood. One that brought community, vital liveliness, and an escape, distracting from the struggle that simply being a Black American brought on throughout the day. The construction of I-94 in 1968 divided this community and displaced thousands of Black Americans into a rather racially segregated and discriminatory housing market. The community has never been the same since. Though there are initiatives to keep the Rondo community alive. The Rondo Community Outreach Library hopes to bring back the community that once was. The library is also home to a special collection of Rondo artifacts and information, capturing and showcasing the rich history of the neighborhood.\nAs we exist in a digital age, there is an increasing amount of mandatory technology usage due to jobs, media, news, communication, and more being normally found on the internet. Therefore, adaptation to this new digital age must occur among older populations of people. It is becoming ever more necessary to become more knowledgeable about online resources as doctor appointments, meetings, and other activities have switched to online interfaces. Based on this, in since October of 2022, Jenaya Myvett, an instructor and Rondo Black American community engagement specialist, made it her mission to make sure that a lack of technology is not a hindrance to the Rondo community’s ability to apply to jobs, communicate with others, schedule doctor’s appointments, simply peruse the internet, and perform other internet activities. To do this, she constructed a technology certification class in which to unite the community and help them achieve digital literacy at the same time.\nIn my position, I am tasked with answering questions, explaining concepts, and making sure that the class is running smoothly. I effectively assist 10+ adults per week in earning certificates in digital literacy. I actively proctor 4+ practice exams per week, helping students gain competency in digital literacy. Additionally, I build connections between myself and the Rondo community. This position has been one of both teaching and learning for me in a way that I could have never imagined, and I am so grateful to Jenaya Myvett, the volunteers, and the students that make this a reality.\nCredit: https://www.macalester.edu/community-engagement/academiccivicengagement/historic-rondo-neighborhood/\nMore information on Rondo: https://libguides.mnhs.org/rondo/ov and https://reconnectrondo.com/vision/"

    "text": "In the 1930s, Rondo Avenue was at the heart of St. Paul, Minnesota’s largest Black neighborhood. One that brought community, vital liveliness, and an escape, distracting from the struggle that simply being a Black American brought on throughout the day. The construction of I-94 in 1968 divided this community and displaced thousands of Black Americans into a rather racially segregated and discriminatory housing market. The community has never been the same since. Though there are initiatives to keep the Rondo community alive. The Rondo Community Outreach Library hopes to bring back the community that once was. The library is also home to a special collection of Rondo artifacts and information, capturing and showcasing the rich history of the neighborhood.\nAs we exist in a digital age, there is an increasing amount of mandatory technology usage due to jobs, media, news, communication, and more being normally found on the internet. Therefore, adaptation to this new digital age must occur among older populations of people. It is becoming ever more necessary to become more knowledgeable about online resources as doctor appointments, meetings, and other activities have switched to online interfaces. Based on this, in since October of 2022, Jenaya Myvett, an instructor and Rondo Black American community engagement specialist, made it her mission to make sure that a lack of technology is not a hindrance to the Rondo community’s ability to apply to jobs, communicate with others, schedule doctor’s appointments, simply peruse the internet, and perform other internet activities. To do this, she constructed a technology certification class in which to unite the community and help them achieve digital literacy at the same time.\nIn my position, I am tasked with answering questions, explaining concepts, and making sure that the class is running smoothly. I effectively assist 10+ adults per week in earning certificates in digital literacy. I actively proctor 4+ practice exams per week, helping students gain competency in digital literacy. Additionally, I build connections between myself and the Rondo community. This position has been one of both teaching and learning for me in a way that I could have never imagined, and I am so grateful to Jenaya Myvett, the volunteers, and the students that make this a reality.\nCredit: https://www.macalester.edu/community-engagement/academiccivicengagement/historic-rondo-neighborhood/\nMore information on Rondo: https://libguides.mnhs.org/rondo/ov and https://reconnectrondo.com/vision/"

    "text": "One of the projects that I worked on with professor Markram Soui of the University of Michigan-Flint and Ms. Nesrine Mansouri, a University of Michigan-Flint doctoral student focused on analyzing common website accessibility issues.\nWith this project, the aim was to strategize and configure a way to automatically detect website and application accessibility issues that may prevent people with disabilities from using them effectively. To do this, we utilized automatic accessibility testing automation tools such as WAVE Accessibility Checker to identify and fix accessibility issues of the evaluated applications. In our work, we explored 115 different websites across over 6 different fields, including education, transportation, healthcare, finance, news, social media, etc. From our analysis, we found over 50+ different accessibility issues of varying levels of issue severity.\nAfter compiling over 1000+ rows of data concerning the issue type, interface concerned, issue importance, issue occurrence number, WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) level and category, proposed improvement according to WGAC standards, and more data, we sought to explore different research questions utilizing our compiled data. Through our data, we examined patterns of accessibility issues across fields and compared the number of visual components (structural elements and features) with the number of accessibility issues to explore the correlation between these. In addition to this, we proposed research questions exploring the co-occurrence of accessibility issues across fields, evaluated the compliance of these webpages to the WCAG categories of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust, and measured their adherence to each of the WCAG 2.1 conformance levels (A, AA, AAA) per field. Among these subjects, we explored more than just this, all of which was composed within the papers that we had drafted within the research experience, which will be published soon.\nProduct:\nLink to published paper coming soon, December 2024."

    "text": "Do you or a lot of the people you know, recycle? Do you recycle batteries and/or metal scraps? Do you compost food scraps? If you do, do you have to pay to recycle these things? Where do you go to recycle? Is this place accessible to everyone despite socioeconomic status, religion, educational status, race, etc.? If you don’t recycle, what’s stopping you from recycling more materials? What does recycling do exactly? Who first taught you about recycling? Was this education comprehensive? How are you keeping up to date with your recycling knowledge and is this easily accessible to everyone?\nMacalester College was awarded a $1.77 million grant from the Department of Energy through its Battery Recycling, Reprocessing, and Battery Collection Funding Opportunity. Led by Dr. Roopali Phadke, CollectED is a three-year project aimed in implementing battery sustainability initiatives. In addition, CollectED aims to create a replicable energy storage education and outreach curriculum that starts with Minnesota and extends to other states. This led through a three pronged project, the first step to gather a comprehensive understanding of what, on average, people know and don’t know about battery recycling. The end goal though, is to be able to make recycling battiers and other “nontraditional recycling materials” easier and more accessible for everyone (regardless of socioeconomic status, and other barriers, to recycle.\nIn August of 2024, I began working with Dr. Roopali Phadke of Macalester College. My role was to collect field data concerning environmental and recycling knowledge among the public, collecting over 1000 surveys from MN residents. Furthermore, to design and structure a data set from which we will use for data analysis and then perform the data analysis to then compile graphical and numerical summaries of our findings. These will help us to construct a core curriculum covering what is known and unknown about recycling and battery usage. Additionally, the result will be used to improve the environmental knowledge of the public by creating an infographic concerning what we know and what we don’t know at a booth at the Minnesota State Fair in 2025.\n \nMore information regarding project here.\n\n\nProduct: Research and completed projects will continue into 2028"

    "text": "Here, I worked with two other group members. We performed dimension reduction to investigate a data set based on the highest songs on a Billboard. From this investigation, we found very valuable information regarding the data set and had a lot of takeaways regarding data analysis and the best ways to present data/or the result to different audiences. Firstly, we had to make sure that the original data was securely preserved while also creating variability within the data. With that understanding, we thought dimension reduction was the best to be used to perform this analysis. We found percentages of original data and variability are represented by each principal component by utilizing tables and graph elements composed within Rstudio. In this example, we would find that establishing 7 principal components within our analysis is ideal because it would retain approximately 80% cumulatively of the original data while also allowing for variability.\nWithin this project, we were able to experiment with different machine learning models and analyses. With this, further knowledge was gained on how to store data and the best way to experiment with and represent data in a way that is easy to understand for the viewers, researchers, and statisticians alike."

    "text": "For this TidyTuesday, I have decided that I am going to use the Valentines day datasets, which comes from a Kaggle dataset uploaded by Suraj Das in 2021. The Kaggle user collected the data from here. This links is to the National Retail Federation’s website. This foundation reports data collected from surveys taken by consumers on how they plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day annually over the course of years, spanning 10+ years. In this, within this dataset we analyze the average amount of money spent per year on each individual item as a single unit of observation.\nResearch Question: How does spending on different items for valentines vary yearly? Is there certain gifts that were popular during a certain year?\nThe figure pictured depicts the relationship between the change in spending of Flowers, Candy, Jewelry, GreetingCards, Clothing, GiftCards and Inflation_rate during Valentines day over the course of the years 2010 to 2022. We observe different colored lines for each item that we are tracking the change in spending of.\nOverall, the lines follow a overall net positive trend with Jewelry as the steepest line. This compared with an interest rate line which maps the percent of interest change over the years, which the line for GreetingCards and GiftCards seem to follow similar trends with. This observation indicating that the amount of money spent on GreetingCards and GiftCards has remained fairly consistent, comparatively.\nIn the opposite fashion, we find that the amount spent on jewelry over the years varies greatly by year with no specific pattern. With this, we would need to conduct further research on surrounding factors including jewelry specific inflation rates, and jewelry trends over the years, among more to find further variables that are able to explain the pattern we observe in the percent change of spending on jewelry from the years 2010 to 2022.\nFlowers also seemed to be close in consistency to the inflation rate’s slope. In this, we can infer that people spend the same amount of flowers yearly, though, this price went up due to inflation and not due to people buying more (and/or more expensive!) flowers for their loved ones.\nFurthermore, Candy and Jewelry seem to be very variable dependent on the year as we observe the percent change at different levels throughout the years, though the two stay pretty consistently popular for Valentines Day Gifts. We also see these two struck the hardest (negatively) by the COVID pandemic of 2021. During 2021, it seems as though it was more popular to spend more money on GiftCards and Clothing for your loved ones’ valentines day.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nhistorical_spending &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-02-13/historical_spending.csv')\n\ninflation_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Year = c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022),\n  inflation_rate = c(12.33, 12.72, 12.98, 13.17, 13.39, 13.4, 13.57, 13.86, 14.21, 14.46, 14.63, 15.32, 16.55)\n)\n\nhistorical_spending &lt;- inflation_data %&gt;% \n  left_join(historical_spending, by = \"Year\")\n\np &lt;- historical_spending %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(cols = c(Flowers, Candy, Jewelry, GreetingCards, Clothing, GiftCards, inflation_rate), \n                 names_to = \"spending_on\", \n                 values_to = \"percentage\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(spending_on) %&gt;%\n  mutate(percent_change = (percentage - percentage[Year == 2010])/percentage[Year == 2010]) %&gt;%\n      ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = percent_change, color = spending_on)) +\n    geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_wsj() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2010,2022,by =2)) + \n  labs(x = \"Year\", \n       y = \"Percent Change Per Year\", \n       color = 'Spending Category:',\n       caption = \"Data Sourced from: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-02-13/readme.md \\n\n       Read more about this data and explore: https://nrf.com/research-insights/holiday-data-and-trends/valentines-day/valentines-day-data-center\",\n       title = \"Mapping Historical Spending Change Over the Years\") +\n  theme(\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 5),\n        legend.position = \"inside\",\n        legend.position.inside = c(0.3, 0.8),\n        legend.key.spacing.x = unit(5, \"pt\"),\n        legend.key.spacing.y = unit(5, \"pt\"),\n        legend.text = element_text(margin = margin(l = 2)),\n        legend.box.background = element_rect(color = \"black\"),\n        legend.title.position = \"top\", \n        legend.title= element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5))"
