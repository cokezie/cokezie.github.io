## Transformative Pedagogies Institute 

Transformative pedagogy is a teaching method that encourages students and teachers alike to critically examine their previous and current beliefs, values, and knowledge. It aims to help people develop a sense of critical consciousness, agency, and empathy to appreciate different perspectives. The Transformative Pedagogies Summer Institute is one component of Macalester's three-pronged initiative that focuses on transforming what is taught and how it is taught at Macalester. I am extremely elated to be a part of this initiative and to help create a more inclusive, diverse, and respectful environment within the classrooms. I personally relate to this topic. As an African immigrant from Nigeria, the way in which I was raised and the intersectional world view that I hold are unique to me. Because of this, I don't always feel that my opinion and/or suggestions are valued in classroom settings.

For the most part, the people that I interact with in my classes, both professors and students alike, do not look like me, nor think like me, and thereby cannot relate to my experiences and the building blocks on which I stand to form my worldview and opinions. These experiences are common among people who have marginalized identities, and they shouldn't be. This is the driving force inspiring me to create more enriching and diverse classrooms so that people don't have to feel the same way that I have in the past.

In Macalester's transformative pedagogies institute, I work with a team under the leadership of Professor Ebony Aya, a scholar in her own right, to cultivate a learning environment for both professors and students alike, learning rich in perspective, understanding, and empathy. Our team is composed of many professors from various departments and a diverse array of students. We have all come together with an awareness that growth and change need to happen at and beyond Macalester. With this in mind we work to accomplish a goal to create classrooms that are more centered on developing a sense of critical consciousness and empathy towards differing opinions.

Additionally, this program initiates learning how to navigate conversations about race, upbringing, and culture in a way that appreciates, validates, and creates learning opportunities for every person's individual experience, no matter how different it might be from our own. I will close with a quote that I like from a Macalester graduate, Gabby Whitehurst, who said, "In a society that runs off of complacency and a stunted imagination, building your capacity to just think is extremely powerful. [Acting] without introspection doesn't necessarily lead to growth and is often reactionary, rather than being rooted in omnipresent love for human rights," and within this Transformative Pedagogies Institute, I have a personal goal to implement these words within my work and life.

## Skyline Towers Volunteer 

As someone who deeply values family and a caring community, I found it extremely hard to leave my family, uncles, cousins, and friends to move from Detroit, MI, to St. Paul, MN. This was hard because I was going to miss the people that I have loved and known all my life. I wasn't sure if I would be able to make connections like that again. As a result of this experience, I made it a mission to commit to finding, if not creating, a caring community of my own. I was able to find this through volunteering with the Commonbond communities within the Skyline Tower of St. Paul. Commonbond is an affordable housing nonprofit that serves low-income communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and South Dakota. My commitment to serving these communities in my little way is a welcome opportunity, which I would not gain any other way.

In my position as a Commonbond volunteer, I worked to build trust and a community bond between myself and the kids under my care, utilizing social-emotional learning (SEL) activities along with making sure that we were completing their assigned reading for their grade level. I made sure to exercise patience, understanding, and respect in my interactions, ensuring that I was setting a good example for the kids around me. I worked to adapt to different grade levels and learning styles with the aim of helping each individual student meet their individual needs. That is, to successfully complete their assignments and reading goals. I also led and facilitated discussions with the kids with the aim of achieving two practical reading goals per week.

## Orientation Leader 

In furtherance to my goal of community engagement, this past summer, I served as an orientation leader to 16 freshmen individuals with diverse backgrounds and interests. In this role, I led, planned, and facilitated one-on-one discussions, group discussions, and organized group meetings covering such topics as what it means to be a part of Macalester College, including providing them with information regarding mental, physical, and sexual health, Title IX, academic integrity policies, etc. I also advised them on how to be successful in college, showed them where their classes are, and told them quirkities and traditions of Macalester College.

I also organized a night when everyone from our original orientation group reconvened to share letters that they wrote to themselves with the group, catch up with some of the first people that they met at Macalester, enjoy good food, and for me, to catch up with them and their challenges. During this meeting, based on their challenges, I will check if there is additional assistance that I can provide to help them have a fruitful Macalester education and experience. Also at this meeting, we reflected on their first thoughts when they first arrived on campus and explored what had changed since then.

The aim of all this was to help these students feel at home at Macalester College. The bottom line is that college is a major commitment. Macalester is a place where they will not only find forever friends but a second home and a welcoming community. A community that will be there during the thick and thin days of college life. Additionally, a place where they will be intellectually, emotionally, and physically challenged in a way that no other institution can.

For me, I have enjoyed this experience and have learned a lot about how to create and sustain a community as well as how to effectively lead a group while also prioritizing everyone's individual needs.

## Mac Mentors 

The Mac Mentorship Program is a year-long mentoring program between Macalester students and high school juniors and seniors in the TRIO Upward Bound program at North Hennepin Community College (NHCC). The program begins in the spring semester and continues to the fall semester of the 2025 academic year. As a mentor, I will be working with the same group of mentees starting from their junior year to senior year. This program provides guidance and support to high school students, including integrating them into the college community. With this experience, I hope to learn about the difficulties that others face as they begin their college application and finally as they secure admission into college. Also, I hope to learn about securing the finance that is required for their education, including becoming acquainted with the common questions associated with college and what others find difficult about the experience. There is no question that with this experience, there is much to learn and skills to repurpose.

## Rondo Community Outreach Library - Teaching Assistant

In the 1930s, Rondo Avenue was at the heart of St. Paul, Minnesota's largest Black neighborhood. One that brought community, vital liveliness, and an escape, distracting from the struggle that simply being a Black American brought on throughout the day. The construction of I-94 in 1968 divided this community and displaced thousands of Black Americans into a rather racially segregated and discriminatory housing market. The community has never been the same since. Though there are initiatives to keep the Rondo community alive. The Rondo Community Outreach Library hopes to bring back the community that once was. The library is also home to a special collection of Rondo artifacts and information, capturing and showcasing the rich history of the neighborhood.

As we exist in a digital age, there is an increasing amount of mandatory technology usage due to jobs, media, news, communication, and more being normally found on the internet. Therefore, adaptation to this new digital age must occur among older populations of people. It is becoming ever more necessary to become more knowledgeable about online resources as doctor appointments, meetings, and other activities have switched to online interfaces. Based on this, in since October of 2022, Jenaya Myvett, an instructor and Rondo Black American community engagement specialist, made it her mission to make sure that a lack of technology is not a hindrance to the Rondo community's ability to apply to jobs, communicate with others, schedule doctor's appointments, simply peruse the internet, and perform other internet activities. To do this, she constructed a technology certification class in which to unite the community and help them achieve digital literacy at the same time.

In my position, I am tasked with answering questions, explaining concepts, and making sure that the class is running smoothly. I effectively assist 10+ adults per week in earning certificates in digital literacy. I actively proctor 4+ practice exams per week, helping students gain competency in digital literacy. Additionally, I build connections between myself and the Rondo community. This position has been one of both teaching and learning for me in a way that I could have never imagined, and I am so grateful to Jenaya Myvett, the volunteers, and the students that make this a reality.
