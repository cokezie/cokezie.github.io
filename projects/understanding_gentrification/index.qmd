Cities' recent decision to address climate change through urban greening initiatives, has led to concerns of potential green gentrification. Green gentrification describes how green initiatives, like park implementation and tree planting, can increase property values and displace longtime residents. Our final project for "ENVI 277:Sustainable Cities" examines if green initiatives in the Twin Cities have been the cause for patterns of racial and spatial inequality. Focusing on green infrastructure efforts and demographic shifts, we explore how climate resilience projects can unintentionally exclude. Through this, we seek pathways for equitable, community-driven urban sustainability and development efforts.

Work produced in collaboration with: Oliver Matus-Bond, Sovann-Jahlee White and Aisling Li.
