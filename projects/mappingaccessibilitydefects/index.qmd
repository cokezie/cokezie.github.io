One of the projects that I worked on with professor Markram Soui of University of Michigan-Flint and a University of Michigan-Flint PhD student Nesrine Mansouri focused on analyzing common website accessibility issues. 

With this project, the aim was to strategize and configure a way in which to automatically detect website and application accessibility issues that may prevent people with disabilities from using them effectively. To do this, we utilized automatic accessibility testing automation tools such as WAVE Accessibility Checker to identify and fix accessibility issues of the evaluated applications. In our work, we explored 115 different websites across over 6 different fields including education, transportation, healthcare, finance, news, social media, etc. From which to find over 50+ different accessibility issues of varying levels of issue severity. 

After compiling over 1000+ rows of data concerning the issue type, interface concerned, issue importance, issue occurrence number, WGAC level and category, proposed improvement according to WGAC standards, and more data, we sought to explore different research questions utilizing our compiled data. 

Through our data we sought to examine patterns of accessibility issues across fields, to compare the number of visual components (structural elements & features) with the number of accessibility issues to explore the correlation between these. In addition to this we proposed research questions exploring the co-occurrence of accessibility issues across fields, evaluated the compliance of these webpages to the WCAG categories of Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, & Robust and measured their adherence to each of the WCAG 2.1 conformance levels (A, AA, AAA) per field. Among these subjects within our research we also explored more than just this, all of which is composed within the papers that we had drafted within the research experience, which, when published, will be linked below.
