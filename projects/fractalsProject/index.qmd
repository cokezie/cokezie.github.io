Overall, our general goal with this project was to  to utilize a combination of L-systems and Python Turtle Wirting, in order to display the building process of a fractal tree that could potentially go on forever. We introduced a user interface aspect as we asked the user questions within the Python Console in which to customize their tree. The user could pick artifacts such as how long/big the tree was, how thick the stump is, color customization, how many branches, and even more than that! A run of the program would create a tree of their own design, and display it within a new window.
