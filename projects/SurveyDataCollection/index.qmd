In August of 2024, I began working with professor Roopali Phadke of Macalester College. My role was to collect field data concerning environmental and recycling knowledge among the public, collecting over 900 surveys from MN residents. Furthermore, to design and structure a data set from which we will use for data analysis and then perform the data analysis to then compile graphical and numerical summaries of our findings. These will help us to construct a core curriculum covering what is known and unknown about recycling and battery usage. Additionally, the result will be used to improve the environmental knowledge of the public by creating an infographic concerning what we know and what we don't know at a booth at the Minnesota State Fair in 2025.
