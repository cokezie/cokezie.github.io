In August of 2024 I began working with professor Roopali Phadke of Macalester College, in which to collect field data concerning environmental and recycling knowledge among the general public, collecting over 1000 surveys from MN residents. In this, we plan on preforming data analysis on the results to understand what is commonly known. Using this to then create improve environmental knowledge among the general public by presenting what we know and what we don't know at a booth at the Minnesota state fair of 2025.
