Do you or a lot of the people you know, recycle? Do you recycle batteries and/or metal scraps? Do you compost food scraps? If you do, do you have to *pay* to recycle these things? Where do you go to recycle? Is this place accessible to everyone despite socioeconomic status, religion, educational status, race, etc.? If you don't recycle, what's stopping you from recycling more materials? What does recycling do exactly? Who first taught you about recycling? Was this education comprehensive? How are you keeping up to date with your recycling knowledge and is this easily accessible to everyone?  

Macalester College was awarded a $1.77 million grant from the Department of Energy through its Battery Recycling, Reprocessing, and Battery Collection Funding Opportunity. Led by Dr. Roopali Phadke, CollectED is a three-year project aimed in implementing battery sustainability initiatives. In addition, CollectED aims to create a replicable energy storage education and outreach curriculum that starts with Minnesota and extends to other states. This led through a three pronged project, the first step to gather a comprehensive understanding of what, on average, people know and don't know about battery recycling. The end goal though, is to be able to make recycling battiers and other "nontraditional recycling materials" easier and more accessible for everyone (regardless of socioeconomic status, and other barriers, to recycle.  

In August of 2024, I began working with Dr. Roopali Phadke of Macalester College. My role was to collect field data concerning environmental and recycling knowledge among the public, collecting over 1000 surveys from MN residents. Furthermore, to design and structure a data set from which we will use for data analysis and then perform the data analysis to then compile graphical and numerical summaries of our findings. These will help us to construct a core curriculum covering what is known and unknown about recycling and battery usage. Additionally, the result will be used to improve the environmental knowledge of the public by creating an infographic concerning what we know and what we don't know at a booth at the Minnesota State Fair in 2025.
