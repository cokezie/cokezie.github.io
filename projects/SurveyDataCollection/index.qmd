In August of 2024, I began working with professor Roopali Phadke of Macalester College. My role was to collect field data concerning environmental and recycling knowledge among the public, collecting over 1000 surveys from MN residents. At the conclusion of the data collection, we plan on performing data analysis with the aim of understanding what is commonly known. The result will be used to improve the environmental knowledge of the public by creating an infographic concerning what we know and what we don't know at a booth at the Minnesota State Fair in 2025.
