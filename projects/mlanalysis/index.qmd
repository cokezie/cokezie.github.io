Within a group of three, we performed dimension reduction, to investigate a data set based on the highest songs on.a Billboard. From this, we found very valuable information regarding the data set and had a lot of takeaways regarding data analysis and the best ways in which to present data to different audiences. Firstly, we had to ensure to preserve a good amount of the original data while also creating variability within the data. In this we thought dimention reduction the best was to preform this. We found percentages of original data and variability are represented by each principal component by utilizing table and graph elements preformed in Rstudio. In this example we would find that establishing 7 principal components within our analysis is  ideal because it would retain approximately 80% cumulatively of the original data, while also allowing for variability. 

Within this project we were able to experiment with different machine learning models and analysis. With this a further knowledge is stored of the best ways in which to experiment with and represent data in a way that is easy to understand for the viewer and the statistician alike.
