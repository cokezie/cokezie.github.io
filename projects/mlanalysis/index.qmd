Here, I worked with two other group members. We performed dimension reduction to investigate a data set based on the highest songs on a Billboard. From this investigation, we found very valuable information regarding the data set and had a lot of takeaways regarding data analysis and the best ways to present data/or the result to different audiences. Firstly, we had to make sure that the original data was securely preserved while also creating variability within the data. With that understanding, we thought dimension reduction was the best to be used to perform this analysis. We found percentages of original data and variability are represented by each principal component by utilizing tables and graph elements composed within Rstudio. In this example, we would find that establishing 7 principal components within our analysis is ideal because it would retain approximately 80% cumulatively of the original data while also allowing for variability.

Within this project, we were able to experiment with different machine learning models and analyses. With this, further knowledge was gained on how to store data and the best way to experiment with and represent data in a way that is easy to understand for the viewers, researchers, and statisticians alike.
