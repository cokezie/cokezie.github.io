 Title: "Where is Chi Chi?"

## Where in the world is Chi Chi right now? 

If you're curious where in the world Chi Chi is at the moment, here are some indicators of my current endevors. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

# Coordinates for Sarah Baartman Hall
uct_coords <- c(-33.9570, 18.4607)

# Create leaflet map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = uct_coords[2], lat = uct_coords[1], zoom = 16) %>%
  addMarkers(
    lng = uct_coords[2],
    lat = uct_coords[1],
    popup = "Sarah Baartman Hall, University of Cape Town",
    icon = makeIcon(
      iconUrl = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pointhi/leaflet-color-markers/master/img/marker-icon-2x-blue.png",
      shadowUrl = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/leaflet/0.7.7/images/marker-shadow.png",
      iconWidth = 25, iconHeight = 41,
      iconAnchorX = 12, iconAnchorY = 41,
      shadowWidth = 41, shadowHeight = 41
    )
  )
```
