## About Me 

**Introductions:** Hi! My name is Chukwubunkem (Chi-Chi), I am a Nigerian immigrant, sister to two, friend and coworker to many. I am a full-time student of Macalester College, a junior in fall 2025. Before college, I resided in Detroit, MI. I am interested in biostatistics, with a major in statistics and a minor in biology. Additionally, I am pursuing a major in sociology in order to study the ways in which environmental/sociological factors influence the public health field. 

**Primary interests:** Primarily, I am interested in participating in multidisciplinary research regarding public health and biostatistics fields. 

**Personal and academic goals:** Following my undergraduate education, I plan to pursue a graduate education focused on furthering research in the biostatistics field with the nuance of sociological perspective. A part of my professional goals is a commitment to bridge interdisciplinary fields with international perspectives and concerns in order to create more holistic research.  I plan to utilize statistical research methods to analyze and critically engage with these fields. Other personal interests include furthering my programming abilities, data analysis skills, exploring different programming languages, practicing ethical data engaging with international perspectives and decreasing my ecological footprint. Finally, my ultimate career goal is to contribute immensely to the fields of public health and biostatistics.
