## About Me 

**Introductions:** Hi! My name is Chukwubunkem (Chi Chi), I am a Nigerian immigrant, sister of two, friend and coworker to many. I am a first year, full-time student of Macalester College, to be a junior in fall 2025. Before college, I resided in Detroit, MI. Currently in college, my interest is in Biostatistics, with a double major in both Statistics and Biology. Additionally, I am pursuing a minor in sociology. 

**Primary interests:** Primarily, I am interested in graphical and statistical models, I enjoy thinking about machine learning, machine learning models (and their limitations) as well as the best ways in which to analyze and present information in a way that is most efficient and easily understandable for the average user. Furthermore I am interested in statistical applications for biology and sociology with a particular interest in public, physical, and mental health.

**Personal and academic goals:** Ideally, I will continue with education following my bachelorâ€™s degree. I plan to obtain a Master's degree and a PhD in the exploration of statistical theory, methods, artificial intelligence learning models and statistical usage within the public heath field. I plan to participate heavily in multifaceted research delving into my interests in sociology and biology in the future. I plan to utilize statistical research methods to deeply analyze and critically engage with these fields. I especially plan to further my interests in biological systems as I am looking forward to going into biostatistics specifically to conduct multidimensional research within this field. I also plan to further my programming abilities in addition to my data analyzing skills, in the future. Additionally, one of my career goals is to make future impacts on the world of public health and biostatistics this by result of my research with specific interests in genetics, infectious diseases, social/emotional well-being. I hope to participate in the furthering of these fields with my research.
